# Go Java Full Stack with Spring Boot and Angularr
I have gained a comprehensive understanding of full-stack web development with Angular and Spring Boot. From mastering Angular's frontend capabilities, including building beautiful user interfaces and utilizing components, data binding, and routing, to seamlessly connecting the front end with Spring Boot's RESTful APIs, I have acquired the skills to develop functional and dynamic web applications. The course also equipped me with essential knowledge in security implementation using Spring Security, ensuring secure authentication and authorization. Additionally, I learned how to connect the REST API with JPA and Hibernate for efficient data persistence, enabling me to create robust full-stack applications. With a focus on best practices and utilization of essential tools, I am now fully prepared to confidently embark on my own full-stack development projects.
